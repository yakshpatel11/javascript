## 🚀 How It Works

1. On load, the app fetches country data (name, capital, flag, currency) from the API.
2. The user can:
   - Scroll through a list of all countries.
   - Click **Favorite** to add a country to their favorites list.
   - Use the **search bar** to filter the list by name.
   - View and manage their **favorite countries** in a separate section.
3. All favorites are saved in `localStorage` so your list stays intact even after a page refresh!
